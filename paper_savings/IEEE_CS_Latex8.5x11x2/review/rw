>
> The paper presents a machine learning approach for creating data-driven models for energy consumption prediction in a smart building.
>
> - The idea is definitely of interest and many groups are working on this domain. The authors gave a nice overview about the need of different abstractions of models.
>
> - Although authors have used a real world test case, the paper could add more discussion. What is the Y axes of the left part of Figure 3.
>

> The review report from reviewer #2:
>
> *8: Detailed comments for the authors
> The paper "Data driven modelling for energy consumption prediction on smart buildings"
> by Gonzalez-Vidal et al. presents a study comparing models to predict a building's
> energy consumption based on outdoor air temperature. Several standard supervised
> machine learning models are tested against a physics-based model that uses a thermal
> resistor-capacitor network (RCN).
>
> The paper's sections are well structured to guide the reader. Tables and figures
> illustrate the work. To provide a first glimpse on the main subject, the writing
> would benefit from a compressed abstract that carves out the essence. A major revision
> of the English grammar and phrases is necessary to allow a fluent reading experience,
> as well as to avoid misconception of the contents presented.
>
> Scientifically the paper provides a style accessible to a general audience. Some
> phrases are too vague or disputable, thus need to be clearified. E.g.
> [...]
> selftuning process (which is different from mathematical models such as regression models)
> [...]
> or
> [...]
> We have avoided the use of change-point models adding novelty to our approach.
> [...]
> Regarding the former one, supervised learning can be actually viewed as a regression
> problem, cf. standard literature such as Chapt. 3 of 'Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning'
> (Bishop, 2009).
> Wrt. the latter, time series that are modeled without change-points could be viewed
> as the trivial case of a change-point model with zero change-points in case the paper
> referres to the topic reviewed in e.g. "A Survey of Methods for Time Series Change Point Detection"
> (Aminikhanghahi & Cook, 2017).
>
> The remaining differentiator of the paper
> [...]
> our method differes from existing [...] we are relating the input as a time series
> with single output.
> [...]
> is standard supervised machine learning. Though, the comparison to the RCN is useful.
> It might be a bit too simplistic? In particular, according to the text, Eq. 1
> reduces to y(t) = A*x(t) + B*u(t) ? A quantitative discussion on the validity of
> comparing this model to the machine learning approach would be beneficial.
>
> Regarding the workshop's focus on IoT and big data analytics the paper's content
> might be too loosely connected. One year of hourly temperature data comprises on
> the order of 10k measurements, i.e. on the order of megabytes of data. Interconnection
> of measurement devices through the internet is not discussed (yet).
>
> To meet common sense publication standards the following formal requirements must
> be met:
> - cut down abstract wrt. to number of words to about 1/3 of what it has right now
> - explain x'(t) in Eq. 1
> - clarify if the term "Octave" referres to the software "GNU Octave"?
>
> ========================================================
> The review report from reviewer #3:
>
> The abstract should be shortened.
> The paper is well balanced between theory and practical application and demonstrates the benefit of working in the overall of big data and IoT.
