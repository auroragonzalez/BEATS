\initial{A}bstract en ingl√©s. In short, the aim of this thesis is to study and improve every step in the data analytics process which leads to provide better services to the citizens in smart environments, that is, smart cities and smart buildings.

Below, we set out the objectives that must be attained for this aim to be fulfilled, which will serve as a guide to how the thesis is developed.

\begin{itemize}

\item O1. Indentify and collect datasets relative to smart environments and determine the nature of the data under study
\item 02. Find appropriate ways to reduce the volume of such data in order to follow the Big Data paradigm
\item 03. Determine the models that better help predict and cluster information regarding energy efficiency
\item 04. Develop an IoT platform oriented towards the proper processing, management and analysis of Big volumes of data 

\end{itemize}
