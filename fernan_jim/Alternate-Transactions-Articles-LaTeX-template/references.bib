    abstract = {{The relative abilities of 2, dimensioned statistics - the root-mean-square error (RMSE) and the mean absolute error (MAE) - to describe average model-performance error are examined. The RMSE is of special interest because it is widely reported in the climatic and environmental literature; nevertheless, it is an inappropriate and misinterpreted measure of average error. RMSE is inappropriate because it is a function of 3 characteristics of a set of errors, rather than of one (the average error). RMSE varies with the variability within the distribution of error magnitudes and with the square root of the number of errors (n1/2), as well as with the average-error magnitude (MAE). Our findings indicate that MAE is a more natural measure of average error, and (unlike RMSE) is unambiguous. Dimensioned evaluations and inter-comparisons of average model-performance error, therefore, should be based on MAE. {\copyright} Inter-Research 2005.}},

We present the R package frbs which implements the most widely used FRBS models, namely, Mamdani and Takagi Sugeno Kang (TSK) ones, as well as some common variants. In addition a host of learning methods for FRBSs, where the models are constructed from data, are implemented. In this way, accurate and interpretable systems can be built for data analysis and modeling tasks. In this paper, we also provide some examples on the usage of the package and a comparison with other common classification and regression methods available in R.},

title = {An Overview of the New Feature Selection Methods in Finite Mixture of Regression Models},
abstract ={
Variable (feature) selection has attracted much attention in
contemporary statistical learning and recent scientific research. This is
mainly due to the rapid advancement in modern technology that allows
scientists to collect data of unprecedented size and complexity. One type
of statistical problem in such applications is concerned with modeling
an output variable as a function of a small subset of a large number of
features. In certain applications, the data samples may even be coming
from multiple subpopulations. In these cases, selecting the correct
predictive features (variables) for each subpopulation is crucial. The
classical best subset selection methods are computationally too expensive
for many modern statistical applications. New variable selection
methods have been successfully developed over the last decade to deal
with large numbers of variables. They have been designed for simultaneously
selecting important variables and estimating their effects in a
statistical model. In this article, we present an overview of the recent
developments in theory, methods, and implementations for the variable
selection problem in finite mixture of regression models.

Only in the past two to three years has there been any evidence of a decline in the incidence of burns. In 1982, more than 2 million patients with burns required medical attention in the United States and more than 10,000 burn-related deaths occurred. Only motor vehicle accidents cause more accidental deaths than burns.}

abstract = "The medical records of 806 adult and paediatric burn patients were retrospectively reviewed. Patient data was summarized, coded and entered in a computer for subsequent analysis.
This report describes the use of multiple regression analysis to produce equations useful for the prediction of the morbidity parameters: length of hospital stay, number of transfusions required and number of operative procedures. The multiple regression equations developed are useful as prediction tools, in patient medical audit and in assessing improvements in burn care.
The classical technique of probit analysis for predicting the probability of mortality was used to develop the LA50's of burn injury. These LA50's were used as the basis for comparison of survival statistics between burned patients in this series and those registered in the National Burn Information Exchange (Feller, 1979). There is an apparent significantly improved survival in the children, young adults through 34 yrs and the older adults (60-74 yrs) in the current series of patients. This observation would support the adoption of the protocol of burn care used in treating these patients.
The newer technique of discriminant analysis is also described. Discriminant analysis is a multifactorial method for discriminating between dichotomous outcomes (survivors and non-survivors). The technique of discriminant scoring proved to be 95.8 per cent accurate in predicting burn survival. Use of a burn severity scoring technique will also assist in recognition of the high risk patient."

Journal = {Burns},
Year = {2002},
Volume = {28},
Number = {6},
Pages = {579-586},
Abstract = {A burn patient may require the most complicated treatment regimes
   encountered among trauma victims. Predicting the outcome of such
   treatment depends on several factors which have non-linear
   relationships. Traditional methods in prediction are ``logistic
   regression{''} and ``maximum likelihood{''}. In this study, an
   artificial neural network (ANN) is used for computing survival among
   burn patients admitted to the ``Motahary Burn Center{''}, during a I
   year period (1996-1997). Fifteen different observations, such as total
   body surface area (TBSA), rescue time, admission period, surgery,
   inhalation injuries, etc. were obtained, retrospectively. A normal feed
   forward ANN was developed by Thinkspro software. It has 15 input-units,
   two hidden layers, and one output-unit. Survival was higher in males,
   those in whom early fluid resuscitation had been initiated and in
   patients in the middle of the age spectrum (P < 0.0001). Strong
   correlations with these factors were noted.
   In the training phase, the ANNs accuracy reached 90\%. In this study,
   the ANN has been applied for the first time to predict burn victim
   survival. This study can enable a different view point to help burn
   center physicians in the prediction of survival of their patients. (C)

The new algorithm does not depend on the \{ANN\} training algorithms or modify the training results. The two groups of weights between input-hidden and hidden-output layers are extracted after training the \{ANN\} on a given database. The general formula for each output node (class) of \{ANN\} is then generated. This formula depends only on input features because the two groups of weights are constant. This dependency is represented by a non-linear exponential function. The \{GA\} is involved to find the optimal relevant features, which maximize the output function for each class. The dominant features in all classes are the features subset to be selected from the input feature group. "

	abstract = "In this study, a hybrid genetic algorithm is adopted to find a subset of features that are most relevant to the classification task. Two stages of optimization are involved. The outer optimization stage completes the global search for the best subset of features in a wrapper way, in which the mutual information between the predictive labels of a trained classifier and the true classes serves as the fitness function for the genetic algorithm. The inner optimization performs the local search in a filter manner, in which an improved estimation of the conditional mutual information acts as an independent measure for feature ranking taking account of not only the relevance of the candidate feature to the output classes but also the redundancy to the already-selected features. The inner and outer optimizations cooperate with each other and achieve the high global predictive accuracy as well as the high local search efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate both parsimonious feature selection and excellent classification accuracy of the method on a range of benchmark data sets. "

	abstract = "The study of the sensitivity and the specificity of a classification test constitute a powerful kind of analysis since it provides specialists with very detailed information useful for cancer diagnosis. In this work, we propose the use of a multiobjective genetic algorithm for gene selection of Microarray datasets. This algorithm performs gene selection from the point of view of the sensitivity and the specificity, both used as quality indicators of the classification test applied to the previously selected genes. In this algorithm, the classification task is accomplished by Support Vector Machines; in addition a 10-Fold Cross-Validation is applied to the resulting subsets. The emerging behavior of all these techniques used together is noticeable, since this approach is able to offer, in an original and easy way, a wide range of accurate solutions to professionals in this area. The effectiveness of this approach is proved on public cancer datasets by working out new and promising results. A comparative analysis of our approach using two and three objectives, and with other existing algorithms, suggest that our proposal is highly appropriate for solving this problem. "

The new idea is to aim explicitly for the maximisation of the dominated hypervolume within the optimisation process. A steady-state \{EMOA\} is proposed that features a selection operator based on the hypervolume measure combined with the concept of non-dominated sorting. The algorithm‚Äôs population evolves to a well-distributed set of solutions, thereby focussing on interesting regions of the Pareto front. The performance of the devised S metric selection \{EMOA\} (SMS-EMOA) is compared to state-of-the-art methods on two- and three-objective benchmark suites as well as on aeronautical real-world applications.

	abstract = "Abstract Many machine learning and pattern recognition applications require reducing dimensionality to improve learning accuracy while irrelevant inputs are removed. This way, feature selection has become an important issue on these researching areas. Nevertheless, as in past years the number of patterns and, more specifically, the number of features to be selected have grown very fast, parallel processing constitutes an important tool to reach efficient approaches that make possible to tackle complex problems within reasonable computing times. In this paper we propose parallel multi-objective optimization approaches to cope with high-dimensional feature selection problems. Several parallel multi-objective evolutionary alternatives are proposed, and experimentally evaluated by using some synthetic and \{BCI\} (Brain‚ÄìComputer Interface) benchmarks. The experimental results show that the cooperation of parallel evolving subpopulations provides improvements in the solution quality and computing time speedups depending on the parallel alternative and data profile.
